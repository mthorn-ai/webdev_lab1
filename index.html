  <p style="font-size: 40px">Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>I am a computer science major and am ready to graduate after this semester!</p>
  <p>I like skateboarding, playing video games, listening to music, watching movies, and reading.</p>
  <p>I am looking to get into web development as a career after I graduate. This topic isn't covered very much in the CS curriculum, but it has interested me for a while.</p>
